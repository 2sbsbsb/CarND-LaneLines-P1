# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

## 	Steps I followed to build pipeline 
	•	Load 1 image
	•	Apply grayscale()
	•	Apply canny()
	•	Apply gaussian_blur()
	•	Apply region_of_interest()
	•	Apply draw_lines()
	•	Apply hough_lines()

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
